      summary: Create company app
      description: >-
        Creates an app associated with a company, associates the app with an API product, and auto-generates an API key for the app to use in calls to API proxies inside the API product. You must create a profile for the company in your organization before you can register apps that are associated with the company.


        **Ensure optimal API product and app security**


        An organization-level property, `features.keymanagement.disable.unbounded.permissions`, strengthens the security of API products in verifying API calls. When the property is set to `true`, the following features are enforced.


        * **App creation**: When creating a developer or company app, the Edge API requires that the app be associated with an API product. (The Edge UI already enforces this.)



        * **API product configuration**: To create or update an API product, the API product must include at least one API proxy or a resource path in its definition.


        * **Runtime security**: API calls are rejected by an API product in the following situations:

          * An API product doesn't include at least one API proxy or resource path. 

          * If the `flow.resource.name` variable in the message doesn't include a resource path that the API product can evaluate.

          * If the app making the API call isn't associated with an API product.


        **Note:** Setting this organization property requires system administrator rights. Edge for Private Cloud system administrators can make add this property on their own with the Update organization properties API. If you are an Edge for Public Cloud user and the previously described restrictions are not in place, contact Apigee Support to set the organization property for you.

            Name of the company app. Required when creating a company app; not required when updating a company app. The name becomes the unique ID of the app for this organization and company. Names must begin with an alphanumeric character and can contain letters, numbers, spaces, and the following characters: `. _ # - $ %`. While you can use spaces in the name, we recommend that you use camel case, underscores, or hyphens instead. Otherwise, you will have to URL encode the app name when you need to include it in the URL of other Edge API calls.
