        \ See <a href=\"https://docs.apigee.com/release/release-stages\">Release Stages</a>.\n\
        * **Only available for Edge for Cloud Enterprise customers with the Advanced\
        \ API Ops option.**\n* You can call this API at most six times per minute.\n\
        \n**Returning results in pages**\n\nBy default, this API returns all activity\
        \ details in a single `logs` array as part of the response object. Because\
        \ there can be a large number of entries in the `logs` array, you can configure\
        \ the API to return the results as a collection of pages. For example:\n\n\
        * On the first call, return the first 25 results in the `logs` array. This\
        \ response contains the first results page.\n* On the second call, return\
        \ the next 25 results. This response contains the second results page.\n*\
        \ Continue until you have returned all entries in the `logs` array.\n\nTo\
        \ configure the API to return results as a collection of pages:\n\n\nOn the\
        \ first call, pass the `page.size` query parameter specifying the number of\
        \ results to return per page.\n\n\n  ```\n\n  https://apisecurity.enterprise.apigee.com/security/users/activity?org={org}&from={start}&to={end}&email={email}&page.size=25\n\
        \n  ```\n\n\n  The response object contains the `page.nextPageToken` property\
        \ that identifies the second page of results:\n\n\n  ```\n\n  \"page\": {\n\
        \    \"current\": 0,\n    \"total\": 0,\n    \"nextPageToken\": \"TOKEN\"\n\
        \  },\n\n  ```\n\n\n  Note that `current` and `total` are always set to 0.\n\
        \n\nOn the second API request, pass the `TOKEN` as the value of the `page.pageToken`\
        \ query parameter to obtain the second page of results.\n\n\n\n  ```\n\n \
        \ https://apisecurity.enterprise.apigee.com/security/users/activity?org={org}&from={start}&to={end}&email={email}&page.size=25&page.pageToken=TOKEN\n\
        \n  ```\n\n\n  The second page of results contains a new `TOKEN` value that\
        \ identifies the third page.\n\n\n  Pass the new `TOKEN` to the API to obtain\
        \ the third page of results.\n\n\nRepeat these steps until you have received\
        \ all the results."
