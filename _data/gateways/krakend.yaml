  description: >
    KrakenD offers two different editions, KrakenD CE (Community Edition)  and KrakenD EE (Enteprise Edition).  The Gateway engine of KrakenD,  an open source project, has joined the Linux Foundation as [Lura](https://github.com/luraproject/lura). KrakenD touts that it's built for performance.  This Gateway is often deployed as a backend-for-frontend or a fa√ßade aggregator on top of many different
    microservices. KrakenD is primarily used as a stateless component in user infrastructure.  There's no data store dependency required for most
    operations, which may simplify deployment and management. Message transformation can be configured using the [Martian DSL](https://github.com/google/martian) while message validation can benefit
    from Google's [Common Expression Language CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec). KrakenD has a JSON-based file configuration with a Web-based editor in
    KrakenD Designer (CE) or KrakenD Studio (EE). Enterprise features include commercial support, KrakenD studio, and enterprise plugins.
