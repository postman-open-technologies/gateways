  description: >
    The REactive Interaction Gatewy is focused on optimizing microservice operations, decoupling the services using some kind of messaging service, like Kafka; now the backend-for-frontends service simply listens to the Kafka stream, where all other services publish their events to. Providing a gateway that subscribes to Kafka topics, while holding connections to all active frontends, forwarding events to the users they're addressed to, all in a scalable way. And on top of that, it also handles authorization, so your services don't have to care about that either.
