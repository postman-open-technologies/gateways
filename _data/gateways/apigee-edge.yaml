    management via a [Portal](../../platform-capabilities/developer-portal/).  While Apigee Edge comes with a number of different delivery options,  newer
    SaaS deliveries seem to be getting pushed more towards [Apigee X](../apigee-x/). Policies for Apigee Edge Gateways are configured with XML and can be
    accessed via a UI, CLI, and API. Apigee Edge has a few different gateway offerings, including both a microgateway  hybrid approach.
