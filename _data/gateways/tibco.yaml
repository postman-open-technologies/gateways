    Employ a wide range of policies to gain control over how, when, and from where your user community can access your APIs. The API Management Control Center lets you fully control your APIs. The traffic manager polices your servers to safeguard them against unauthorized access and overloading. The gateway is available across on-premises and cloud environments, allowing for a single view of all gateways.
