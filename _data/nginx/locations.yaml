          description: >
            Resource name is a unique identifier for a resource
            within the context of a namespace.

            Resource names must conform to [RFC 1738 Section
            2.2](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt) and have a
            valid syntax for email addresses. The following rules
            are enforced:


            - do not utilize URL encoding;

            - do not include spaces;

            - do not use uppercase characters, for example, 'A-Z';
            extended character sets are supported;

            - do not use the following characters: `"`, `*`, `:`,
            `;`, `/`, `\`, `%`, `?`, `hash`, `=`, `&`, `|`, `~`,
            `^`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `<`, `>`;

            - cannot start or end with an `@` sign;


            For example: For a collection resource located at


            `https://controller.example.com/api/v1/services/apps/shopping_@1`


            the resource name is "shopping_@1".
        displayName:
          type: string
          example: My Display Name
          description: >
            `displayName` is a user friendly resource name. It can
            be used to define 

            a longer, and less constrained, name for a resource.


            Display names:


            - are optional (defaults to an empty string if no
            value is provided),

            - do not have to be unique, 

            - cannot be assigned by the server.
        description:
          type: string
          example: >-
            This is a sample description string. It provides
            information about the resource.
          description: >
            `description` is a free-form text property. You can
            use it to provide information that helps 

            to identify the resource.


            Descriptions:


            - are optional (defaults to an empty string if no
            value is provided),

            - do not have to be unique, 

            - cannot be assigned by the server.
        kind:
          type: string
          example: <collection>-<object>
          description: >
            Kind is a string representation of an API resource's
            data type.

            It is assigned by the server and cannot be changed. 


            When creating a `kind`, the server uses hyphens to
            connect word segments; 

            singleton and collection item resources are not
            pluralized.
        uid:
          type: string
          format: uuid
          example: d290f1ee-6c54-4b01-90e6-d701748f0851
          description: >
            Unique Identifier (UID)


            UID is a unique identifier in time and space for a
            resource. 

            When you create a resource, the server assigns a UID
            to the resource.


            Refer to [IETF RFC
            4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122) for more
            information.

            The system uses tag selectors to specify selection
            criteria that 

            match resources that have particular tags.

            A timestamp that represents the server time when the
            resource was created.


            Create time is not guaranteed to be set in
            "happens-before" order

            across separate operations.


            In JSON format, `create_time` type is encoded as a
            string in the

            [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt).


            For example: 2018-04-01T01:30:15.01Z


            Create Time is assigned by the server and cannot be
            changed.
        updateTime:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          example: '2019-07-29T10:12:33.001Z'
          description: >
            A timestamp that represents the server time when the
            resource was last modified.


            Resources that have never been updated do not have an
            `update_time` stamp.


            The default value for resources that have never been
            updated is the local 

            language-specific equivalent of "null".


            In JSON format, `update_time` type is encoded as a
            string as described in 

            [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt).
